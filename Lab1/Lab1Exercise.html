   <h2>Lab QA</h2>
   <P>
      <h3>Think About Event Programming.</h3>
      <p>
         1) What is an event? <br />
         --> When a user interacts with the system(webpage), certain actions/events are noted by the browser 
         and then based on those events, functions can be executed. An example of an event can be a user mouse 
         clicking on a button, or pressing a certain key on the keyboard. <br /><br />

         2) What kinds of things trigger events - are they always the direct result of a user interaction? <br />
         --> As mentioned in the previous question's answer things like a user mouse clicking on a button, pressing 
         a key on keyboard are some common examples of things that trigger events. <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --> No, they are not always direct result of a user interaction. For example, they 
            can be time driven. They can be scheduled to occur at a specific time or intervals. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <h3>Learn About the CS315 Libraries.</h3>
      <p>
         1) What is HTML5 and why is it exciting? <br />
         --> HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that is widely used to make webpages. 
         It is exciting as it allows us to make dynamic and interactive web pages. <br /><br />

         2) What is WebGL2 based on? <br />
         --> It is based on OpenGL ES 3.0.  <br /><br />

         3) Name one classic OpenGL Windowing API and provide a link to some official documentation. <br />
         --> freeglut <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --> Link to the official documentation: <a href="https://freeglut.sourceforge.net/docs/api.php">https://freeglut.sourceforge.net/docs/api.php</a> <br /><br />

         4) What files are in the textbook's Common folder, and what is in them? (be general, summarize) <br />
         --> utility.js = Creation and compilation of shader programs <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flatten.js = A method for converting any vector/array to one dimensional (Float32Array) array <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; initShaders.js = Creating and compiling vertex and fragment shaders (checking for compilation errors) <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; initShaders2.js = Initializing shaders programs <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; initShaders3.js = Mostly similar to initShaders.js (maybe an improved version) <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MV.js = Helper library created by authors of the book being used in the class. It contains definitions for the functions like vec4, vec3, mix, mat3, etc <br />
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MVnew.js = It seems pretty much same as MV.js. Maybe an improved version with some bug fixes. <br /><br />

         5) What is in uofrGraphics.js and where does it come from? <br />
         --> It is a library that simplifies the drawing of a few basic shapes. It comes form the university of Regina. Most probably, 
         it is developed by current lab instructor for CS315, Alex. <br /><br />
